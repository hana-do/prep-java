/***
 * CALL CENTER
 * Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: 
 * respondent, manager, and direct. An incoming telephone must be first allocated to
 * a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must
 * escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it,
 * then the call should be escalated to a director. 
 * Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method a 
 * dispatchCall() which assigns a call to the first available employee.
